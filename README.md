# life management workflow in terminal
- This repository record my daily workflow in terminal.
- This workflow is just a methodology and philosophy, you can develop your own workflow based on it, you don't necessarily have to use the same software or tools as me.
- The purpose of this workflow is to **solve problems** in my life and **develop my passions** through **lifelong learning**.

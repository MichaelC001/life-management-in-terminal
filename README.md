# life management workflow in terminal
- **[Philosophy]** This workflow is just a methodology and philosophy, you can develop your own workflow based on it, you don't necessarily have to use the same software or tools as me.
- **[Purpose]** The purpose of this workflow is to **solve problems** in my life and **develop my passions** through **lifelong learning**.

## 1.Journal structure
- My workflow is based on daily Journal.
- It is a file based system, all notesmare orgnized in folder: one folder one day, one entry one file.

## 2.Hark link and soft link
- The core tool used in this workflow is the system build-in function: hard link and soft link.
- **hard link** : "ln original_file new_file" 
this command creates a new link to the original file, so that any changes made to either file will be automatically synchronized, resulting in both files being exactly the same.
